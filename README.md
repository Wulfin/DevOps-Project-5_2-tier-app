# Project Overview :-
- 🚀 Building a Resilient Flask App with MySQL, Docker, and Docker-Compose🌐
- 🌐 Application Overview :
I’ve developed a Flask-based web application that seamlessly interacts with a MySQL database. Users can submit messages through the user-friendly interface, and these messages are securely stored in the MySQL database, then promptly displayed on the frontend.
- 🐳 Docker Containerization :
For streamlined packaging and deployment, I’ve containerized this application with Docker. This ensures consistent behavior across different environments and simplifies the deployment process.
